        <h1>Getting started with HTML</h1>
        <p>
          In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you
          started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other
          important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit
          into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a
          typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language
          features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with
          HTML too!
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML?">
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is
          a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
          pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
          developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
          you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to
          make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
          content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words,
          and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>
          If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png"
          alt="Anatomy of an HTML document"
        />
        <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this
            example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle
            brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts
            to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the
            paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it
            is the paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
            includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where
            the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common
            beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
          alt="attributes explanation"
        />
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't
          appear in the content. In this example, the
          <code>class</code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the
          element with style information.

          Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's
          examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code
            >
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
             &lt;html&gt; 
                &lt;head&gt;
                   &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt; 
                   &lt;title&gt;
                   My test page 
                   &lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;/head&gt; 
           
               &lt;body&gt; 
                   &lt;p&gt; This is my page &lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/body&gt;
             &lt;/html&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Comments">
        <h2>HTML Comments</h2>
        <p>
          HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore
          comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The
          purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to
          explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a
          code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely
          remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are
          making changes and updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers &lt;!-- and
          --&gt;
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour
          of the basics of HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it
          works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few
          elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go
          further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting
          other concepts of the language.
